# SSiO
SSiO: Sociaetal Development Through Secure IoT amd Open Data 

# Overall project goal
To facilitate information access and understanding of information in everyday environments.
Innovative technologies and services will be developed and tested.

# How to achieve it
We combine data from sensors and open data into useful information, and provide tools to present the information using augmented reality.
The first two years the project will focus on building a platform, and the last year, we want companies and organisations to build services and products based on the platform.

# The longterm goal
As a result of the project the region will have good opportunities to create smartness in products and services that are created. A vision is that everything produced in the region has some sort of ”smartness” (such as Internet of Things). Possibilities to both produce as well as consume information is made possible in both urban and rural areas. The goal is to make the region a leading Smart Region.
